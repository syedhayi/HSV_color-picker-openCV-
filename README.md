Determining the HSV data of any color using Computer_Vision and webcam

HSV Color Scale: The HSV (which stands for Hue Saturation Value) scale provides a numerical readout of your image that corresponds to the color names contained therein. Hue is measured in degrees from 0 to 360. For instance, cyan falls between 181–240 degrees, and magenta falls between 301–360 degrees.

This project was really helpful when i need to specify HSV limit for object follower robot which i made for my university's project.
