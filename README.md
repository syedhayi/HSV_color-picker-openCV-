Determining the HSV data of any color using Computer_Vision and webcam

HSV Color Scale: The HSV (which stands for Hue Saturation Value) scale provides a numerical readout of your image that corresponds to the color names contained therein. Hue is measured in degrees from 0 to 360. For instance, cyan falls between 181–240 degrees, and magenta falls between 301–360 degrees.

with this project you can easily able to get the lower and upper limit of any color's HSV value.
